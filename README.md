# Hi there 👋, I'm Noah Brelage!

I'm an engaged professional bridging the gap between social sciences and technology. I have a background in project management and consulting, complemented by practical skills in Python programming and data analytics. Also, I really enjoy working on projects focussed on sustainability.
I enjoy finding ways of gathering and gaining insights from actually meaningful data as well as actually useful AI implementations.
